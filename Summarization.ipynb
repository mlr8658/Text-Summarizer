Commands can differ based on which operating system and command-line application you're using, but all students are encouraged to learn the prevalent unix-style commands: On Mac OS, the default Terminal application will allow students to use unix-style commands. On Windows OS, the default Command Prompt application uses different commands, but installing the Git Bash application will allow students to use unix-style commands.\"\n",
